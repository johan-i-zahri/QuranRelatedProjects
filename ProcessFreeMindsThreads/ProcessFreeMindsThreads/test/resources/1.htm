								<div class="inner" id="msg_236881">Peace all<br>&nbsp;<img src="1_files/peace.gif" alt=":peace:" title="peace" class="smiley"><br><br>This is an article i wrote. My first on a topic in Quran. If you read it, please let me know what you think:<br><br><br><br>The
 purpose of this article is to argue against the widely accepted belief 
that the Quran prohibits sex before marriage. I intend to do this by 
using the Quran to justify a case of pre-marital sex where it is 
acceptable in the light of the Quran. <br><br>Unless you take the root <strong>Zay-Nun-Ya</strong> or <strong>Fa-Ha-Shin</strong>
 to literally mean premarital sex, the prohibition of sex before 
marriage is not stated in the Quran. There are also no verses in the 
Quran where sex is made exclusive to marriages. <span class="bbc_u">Thus sex is not exclusive to marriages and can be done outside of wedlock</span>.&nbsp;
 The fact that sex is not explicitly prohibited does not mean that it is
 ok to have sex with anyone under any circumstance. The Quran places 
restrictions and limitations which prevent such a scenario. There are 
two limitations which I will point out:<br><br>The first limitation I will explain via the following Verses of 23:5-6<br><br>23:5 And they keep covered their private parts.<br>23:6
 Except around their spouses (azwaaj), or those who are maintained by 
their oaths (ma malakat aymanukum), they are free from blame.<br>23:7 But whoever seeks anything beyond this, then these are the transgressors.<br><br>From these verses, it is clear that none should have access to the private parts except the following two categories: <span class="bbc_u">Spouses
 (Azwaaj) and those who are committed to you by oaths (ma malakat 
aymanukum) Thus SO FAR sex can only be done with those two categories of
 people.</span> However this presents us with a problem as anyone could 
be committed to an individual by oath. Thus theoretically if an orphan 
is committed to you by oath.....then he can have access to your private 
parts. <br><strong>This is where the second limitation comes in: </strong><br><br><strong>Fa-Ha-Shin</strong> which has the possible following meanings: <br>became
 excessive/immoderate/enormous/exorbitant/overmuch/beyond measure, 
foul/bad/evil/unseemly/indecency/abominable, lewd/gross/obscene, 
committing excess which is forbidden, transgress the bounds/limits, 
avaricious, adultery/fornication. <br><br>An example of the usage of Fa-Ha-Shin can be seen in 17:32 And do not come near adultery, for it is lewdness and an evil path.<br><br>If
 we take lewdness into account, then it becomes clear that showing your 
private parts to an orphan who is committed to you by oath is forbidden 
(unless you have a really good and un-lewd reason to do so which is very
 unlikely) Thus (though highly unlikely) no one can claim that they were
 showing their private parts to their orphan and then justify themselves
 with verses such as 23:5-6. Such an act will go strongly against reason
 and heart in which their justification becomes invalid just by that 
alone. Nevertheless for the purposes of this article, <strong>it is an act of lewdness indicated by reason and heart and thus prohibited by the Quran.</strong> Thus this takes out the possibility of all gross acts such as the example given. <br><span class="bbc_u">I will now discuss some of the possible objections to my argument.</span><br><br>One possible objection to my argument, is the following verse: 24:33<br><br>And
 let those who are not able to marry continue to be chaste until God 
enriches them of His Bounty. And if those who are maintained by your 
oaths seek to consummate the marriage, then document it with them if you
 find that they are ready, and give them from the wealth of God which He
 has bestowed upon you. And do not force your young women to need if 
they have desired to be independent, in order that you may make a gain 
in the goods of this worldly life. And if anyone has compelled them, 
then for their compulsion, God is Forgiving, Merciful.<br><br>It 
requests of those who are unable to marry to remain chaste implying that
 they should not have sex until they have married. I disagree with this 
translation and understanding for the following reason: <br><br>If we look at a word by word translation, <strong>the word chaste actually isn&#8217;t there</strong>. What&#8217;s actually used is abstain. But his could mean to abstain from something different to sex such as abstaining from <span class="bbc_u">unlawful</span> sex and not sex as a whole. <br><br>Another possible objection<br>It
 may be argued that the permission to expose the private parts to those 
you are committed to by oath given in the Quran does not include the 
permission to have sex. This is not the case as in order for something 
to be prohibited, it needs to be stated in the Quran. <span class="bbc_u">If it is not stated, then it is not prohibited </span>and
 as sex is not prohibited beyond the limits already discussed, then it 
is permitted. Consider the following: If we are to say that the private 
parts (in the case of those who are committed to an individual by oath) 
are for exposure only and nothing more, then this becomes problematic. 
Imagine a surgeon attempting to operate on an individual&#8217;s private part.
 The surgeon can see the private part of the individual as the surgeon 
is committed to the individual by oath however the surgeon will not be 
able to go beyond seeing the private part (even though the individual 
has consented to operating on the private part) and thus be unable to a 
operate on the individual. This would be the case if we were to accept 
that the private parts can only be exposed and nothing more can be done 
to them.&nbsp; <br><br><strong>Moving on....</strong><br>The concept of 
lewdness is subjective. What may appear lewd to an individual may appear
 normal to another. Consider a one night stand. Some will consider the 
act as lewd and some will think it acceptable. Topics such as a one 
night stand are controversial and open to debate. However when the act 
of sex is done between a couple who are both morally upright and are 
comfortable with each other and are not rushing one another and it does 
not go against their reason and heart prior to the act, then I see no 
controversy in such a case. I doubt that in such a case there is any 
lewdness. If anyone objects to this, please indicate the lewdness you 
pick out from this.<br><br>In conclusion, pre-marital sex is not prohibited in the Quran. <strong>There are clear limitations and subjective limitations</strong>.
 Issues such as a one night stand may possibly be justified in the light
 of the Quran. As outrageous as this claim may appear to some, I truly 
believe that it may hold some truth. <br><br>The end.<br><br><strong>Some addiotional points:</strong><br><br>In
 a discussion with a friend, when attempting to argue against one night 
stands, I could not get anywhere as his argument was clearly the more 
reasonable and stronger. I will present a revised summary of our 
discussion: <em>What could be wrong with two healthy (no disabilities 
such as down-syndrome or any influence of alcohol) and responsible 
people agreeing to have sex on one night even though they have just met 
on the night? I responded by saying that that would make sex meaningless
 and without passion. But would it necessarily do this? I cannot tell. 
And even if it does, how could it be wrong when both have agreed to it 
and it&#8217;s not harming anyone else?</em> (please note this was an argument
 with my friend which I have attempted to summarise. What I have written
 down isn&#8217;t exactly what was said but rather the key points pointed out 
and discussed. My purpose of this example was to show the importance of 
reason and how someone like my friend could justify himself in the sight
 of God) <br><br>I could not answer him and considered that he might be 
right and that my rejection of his view is purely based on my upbringing
 and not of my reasoning. <strong>My heart did object to it at first</strong>
 but I tried to view the act in a different and more positive light in 
order to be unbiased, and my heart did not object to it anymore. Before i
 was viewing this act in a <span class="bbc_u">negative</span> light and
 that is why i believe my heart objected to it then. But both scenarios 
that i attmepted to comprehend can take place in reality. The negative 
more likely to occure then the positive. I dislike the idea of a one 
night stand personally.<br><br>If I am not mistaken, virginity in the 
Iranian culture is seen as a good thing and I believe that this is 
similar amongst Quranists. Ironically virginity in some places and in 
the sight of some people is seen as a bad thing. With the use of reason 
and the Quran, hopefully we will get to the truth.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<img src="1_files/peace.gif" alt=":peace:" title="peace" class="smiley"></div>

they do right between each other maybe? by both mutually agreeing but in

 how does such a relationship happen. I decide I want this you agree 
let&#8217;s get it on? What's the difference from prostitution and that? And 
if it ends that night you never see her and she has a kid? You're 
responsible for a kid you don&#8217;t even know? Anyway there are many 
arguments for and against one night stands lets focus on your opinion 
about sex being ok quranically. <br><br>Quran didn&#8217;t say you&#8217;re allowed

Could you still put up the same argument? <strong>I know that sex and music are not the same things just as music and food are not the same things.&nbsp; But</strong> the key here is <strong> that they are not BAD things unless transgressed.</strong> In sex you could transgress by (I'd rather not go into details) and in food, you could transgress by taking poison. <strong>Food
 is not prohibited (as it is a good in itself), but the poison is and in
 the case of sex, the act of sex itself is not prohibited(as it is not a

else)<br></strong><br><br>Stealing is an obvious bad in itself, and it's explicitly forbidden.<br>If
 sex was a bad in itself, it would have been forbidden. But i could not 
find a reasonable implication and i searched alot and the best i could 
find was 24:33<br>and it was not good enough IMO as i will explain when i move on to the later parts of you post.<br><br>I think you might see pre-marital sex as a BAD IN ITSELF but how would you justify that if that is the case?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The

 agree that it's not just about the looking/seeing, but I thought the 
minimum form of protection starts with protecting it from the sight of 
others. In the case of the surgeon i agree that he is not doing anything

 it wouldn't. Would what your saying not be the equivolent of saying 
that the only purpose of marriage is sex? IMO Marriage is a more serious
 step in life and in a relationship. It is a much more serious 
commitment. Marriage is a commitment for life. Your responsibilities 
towards your partner greatly increases thus you need to have the means. 
Some may hasten towards this step without any idea of the 
responsibillities ahead or the seriousness of the commitment they are 
making. Where as in a relationship, such a responsiblility is not yet 
there. This does not mean or imply that sex is prohibited.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">If

 not all verses. Some clear, some subjective. Lewdness makes this topic 
subjective. People may interpret as they wish, but their intentions and 
heart, they are aware of. Thus The limitations are up to the individuals
 IMO. AS LONG AS THE TWO IN AGREEMENT CAUSE NO HARM TO ANY OTHERS, then 
the rest is between them and God. An individual with the use of their 
heart or reasoning must determine wether they are going against the 
source of righteousness or not. They must choose themselves. My point is
 that the Quran leaves this subjective just like some other issues such 
as dress code.<br><br>Personally i dislike the idea of one night stands 
and i have spoken to a friend who though not religious, shares the same 
views based on his heart and reasoning. I am doing something similar. I 
believe it forbidden to me as i consider it lewd. But I can understand

she has a kid? You're responsible for a kid you don&#8217;t even know? Anyway 
there are many arguments for and against one night stands lets focus on 
your opinion about sex being ok quranically. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>I
 don't believe that there needs to be any contract other then the mutual

 is involved, it will most likely fall under an on the spot kind of

prostitute. One is getting paid the other is not. One does so for a 
living the other does so for fun/pleasure. A protitute may do this for 
both reasons....I don't know. My point is that both could be lewd and 
against AQ or both could be right and in line with AQ depending on the 
individuals. We cannot condemn or condone them IMO as nothing in AQ 
gives us to do so with except the subjective term of lewdness which 
means we can only disucss them unless (they harm others with their

 if some guy says to some girl "sex?" and she says "ok" and they begin, 
how can i fault them with respect to the Quran? What wrong have they 
done if they have not done anything against their heart reason and

greatly valuable blessing. Overdo it and you may lose your your passion 
or apetite for it. This is a kind of transgression. Thus if the guy who 
asks the girl has just come back after......with another girl, then this
 can be argued to be overdoing it.<br><br>My reasoning would say i could not know. It is subjective <strong>unless others are harmed</strong>.
 I cannot disapprove or approve as i am not them. For me, a one stand is
 wrong thus if i carry it out, i would believe that i have done wrong

 it may not be wrong. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Virginity

 UK there are many divorces and children suffer as a result. Marriage is
 not wrong but the way that some people in the UK carry it out is wrong 
and it leads to divorce and suffering for the kids. Same with this. Some
 will misuse and leave a girl there pregnant after a night. But how has 
such an individual used their heart reason and logic? How did such a

 surgeon is doing good, by performing the operation. What good do you 
get from premarital sexual relations? Other than fulfilling a desire? 
Especially if it&#8217;s just one girl you met one night and decide you wanna 
fling. </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>What's
 wrong with fulfilling a desire if it does not contradict with morals? 
Fulfilling desires is wrong only when they contradict morals and 
principles as that is when you are only following your desire.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">We&#8217;re
 warned to stay away from zina, fahsha. I know it encompasses more than 
what the typical muslim thinks but how do you see it?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Zina to me is when some who is married, has sex outside of marriage. In other words, adultery<br>Fahsha
 is subjective yet clear in certain cases such as porn or sexual 
fetishes and so on. To watch them is a type of lewdness IMO.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">No
 I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s the only purpose but for some it could be. Though 
what are you saying then, a premarital relationships is just for sex? So
 MMA aren&#8217;t necessarily commitments for life their comments for when we 
both want? Sounds kinda prostitutional don&#8217;t you think?<br><br>Relationships
 without responsibility? Whoever came up with that nonsense? Lots of 
people don&#8217;t get married unless they have the means. why is marriage 
much more committed than a premarital relationship? even you recognise 
less commitment in such a relationship<br><br>Sex is a responsibility 
just because people use protection it doesn&#8217;t mean the lady will never 
get pregnant. It happens, what then? You think the baby won&#8217;t be your 
responsibility? Or is a premarital responsibility pleasure only? </blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>Again
 i will say that i agree with marriage as a stronger commiment then a 
premarital relationship BUT this does not mean that sex is exclusive to 
marriages. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ok, it seems odd to think two people agree on having sex together as righteous.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>It
 is not about wether it is righteouss. it is about wether it is 
unrighteouss or not. If unrighteouss, then wrong and thus most likely 
prohibited. If not then most likely not prohibited. I am not claiming 
that having sex=righteoussness. What i am claiming is that if two people
 agree to have sex, it is not NECCESSARILY unrighteouss.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Dress code isn&#8217;t totally subjective, it states what is necessary.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div> <br><br>Same with premarital sex.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The heart can be influenced by desire, reason can also be influenced how can you be sure your reasoning is just? <br></blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>You have no other tool to use in life. <strong>Everything</strong>
 goes through the heart and reason. Individuals are responsible for 
using these tools given to them as correctly as possible and to the best
 of their abillity. That means IMPARTIALLITY and openmindedness and the 
refusal to manipulate your own reason to suite your desire. You will be 
held accountable for such misuses.<br>&nbsp;<br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Ok,
 a waiting period for a divorced women is like what? 3 months? 3 period 
cycles? If I had sex &#8216;cos I thought it&#8217;s halal and then decided nah 
stuff this guy the neighbour next door is looking pretty cute and decide
 to sleep with him? Do I have to wait 3 period cycles? or not, does this
 rule only apply to the one married? don&#8217;t you think quran would be 
clear about it if it was ok to have sex before marriage</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>The
 waiting period is specific to divorce. So in the exmaple you give, no 
you don't. You could just jump from one guy to another if it does not go
 against your moral principles. I was thinking if sex before marriage 
was prohibited, it would have been made clear just as zina is made 
clear. As it is not and as there are restrictions and limitations with 
respect to sex, i understand that all sex is allowed except what is 
restricet and limited. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">How is this not injustice? It seems to me that it&#8217;s more about selfish pleasure</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>Selfish
 pleasure? Both sides are agreeing to something! They are both 
fulfilling a desire. IF IT CONFLICTS WITH THEIR MORALITY, THEN IT 
BECOMES AN ISSUE. THAT IS WHEN <em>ONLY</em> THE DESIRE IS BEING FOLLOWED. Considering what i've just said how else can you say this is wrong?<br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">otherwise why not marry the guy/girl? Is it simply a finance issue, or is it more than that?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>It could be finance, it could be that the individuals are not seeking anything long term, it could be various other reasons. <br>You
 are saying that because they refuse to marry, they are being selfish? 
Because they do not restrict sex untill marriage they are being selfish?
 <strong>How are they being selfish when they are not harming anyone else and they both agree to this?</strong><br><br>This
 subject could have a million if&#8217;s and buts, how can you genuinely be 
sure this person takes you seriously, they don&#8217;t want to commit to a 
relationship other than sex? They don&#8217;t want marriage then what the hell
 do they want to fulfil their desires? Aren&#8217;t we told about people who 
take up their desire as their Lords and warned about it?[/quote] <br><br>Ok
 so basically your saying that you shouldn't enter a relationship just 
for sex and that if you do so, theres a chance that you could take your 
desire as your lord. On what grounds? Two people get in a relationship 
just so they could fulfill their desire of let's say singing to each 
other. Have they taken their desire as their lord?? <br><br><strong>You become a slave to your desire when you reject your moral principles for your desire</strong>. Thus if the two who entered a relationship just so they could sing to one another <strong>and by singing they have gone against their moral principles, then they have possibley taken their desire as their lord.</strong>
 The same could be said about sex. I think (not sure just making a 
guess) the issue here is that you see the act of sex as someting that's 
bad initself regardless of wether it goes against prinicples or not. So 
even if i describe the least controversial scenario of premarrital sex, 
you would still reject it on the basis that why don't they just wait 
untill their married and that they are being selfish and giving into 
their desire if they don't. <br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">The
 last sentence made me laugh lol so having some fun = controlling desire
 more like feeding it and partaking in it? Food is good yeh? but we 
muslims can&#8217;t eat pig meat though if you agree that you want to eat pig 
meat you&#8217;re not harming anyone, what is the wrong in that?</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>Ye i guess it was a pretty funny link <img src="1_files/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley">
 but relevant. If you have sex every 2 hours (though impossible), most 
likely you'll get bored of it or just lose the desire to have sex for a 
while. This is regardless of wether your in a marriage or not. If your 
in a marriage and you have sex too much, then you have transgressed and 
most likely you will not have the same passion or enjoymen as you could 
have. This is what i was trying to convey.<br><br>As for swine, it is clearly forbidden to us muslims.<br>Premarrital sex is not <img src="1_files/cheesy.gif" alt=":D" title="Cheesy" class="smiley"> Could you provide a reasonable verse for this?<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Probably,
 though as a muslim you know you have the responsibility of your own 
child whether you divorce the wife or not. Generally people won&#8217;t marry 
an idiot, usually they marry someone because they have feelings, trust 
them or have some sort of traits, attributes, compatibility they like. 
Fall outs happen because humans are weak people aren&#8217;t always just. A 
guy isn&#8217;t always at fault.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div>Mostly agreed.<br><br><div class="quoteheader"><div class="topslice_quote">Quote</div></div><blockquote class="bbc_standard_quote">Premarital
 relations are abused, you said &#8220;fun&#8221; who said marriage can&#8217;t be fun? if
 premarital relations are solely about fun well that doesn&#8217;t seem so 
ethical it seems to be a life just about sex.</blockquote><div class="quotefooter"><div class="botslice_quote"></div></div><br>I
 certainly did not say marriage can't be fun. I though it was meant to 
be fun, fulfilling, beautiful and so on. Ok for less controversy let us 
assume a premarital sexual relation where sex is not the focal point. 
The focal point is how well the two get along. Note that this does not 
mean no sex. Sex will happen about eeeehhhh lets say once every two 
weeks (just to make sure their not transgressing <img src="1_files/angel.gif" alt=":angel:" title="angel" class="smiley">) Now would still say this is wrong???</div>
